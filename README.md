Good morning! Today is your lucky day, because I am going to tell you about my favorite programming language, TypeScript.

TypeScript is currently the 5th most commonly used coding language, after only JavaScript, HTML, SQL and Python. In the 2023 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, more than 43% of professional developers said they use TypeScript. [Source](https://i.giphy.com/media/XbmdBop1Fn6J3dT6U6/giphy.webp)

If you decide you want to learn TypeScript, I have some great news for you: you already know most of it.

That’s because if JavaScript is your vanilla ice cream, TypeScript is the banana split: it’s just vanilla JavaScript with some additional functionality added on top, like whipped cream and chocolate sauce and sprinkles.

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. All your existing JavaScript code will run in TypeScript, but you’ll also have typing tools to help you write more readable and maintainable code and catch errors more quickly.

One part that might seem a little counter-intuitive is that TypeScript can’t run in your browser — it’s compiled down to JavaScript. So its sole purpose is to make the development process easier and more efficient; but at runtime, all the sprinkles are removed and it’s just plain JavaScript.


## JavaScript

Now, JavaScript has a lot of advantages:

* Runs in browsers
* Easy to learn and write
* Versatile
* Flexible

But some of these benefits can become shortcomings once the applications we are building become exponentially larger and more complex. TypeScript was first released by Microsoft in 2012 to overcome these shortcomings, while still retaining the best things about JavaScript.

So, what are these amazing TypeScript features, and why do we need them?

## Official TypeScript Documentation

TypeScript's official [Getting Started Guide](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-tooling-in-5-minutes.html)


## Running files

To run the code in `javascript.js`, enter `node javascript.js` in your terminal.

In this project, I added a library to allow me to run the typescript from my terminal.

To run the code in `typescript.ts`, enter `npx ts-node typescript.ts --esm` in your terminal.


## Advanced Topics

If there is extra time:

- External library support: Many npm packages supply types used along with code files
- [Utility types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html)
- [Generics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html)
- [Classes](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/classes.html)
- [Debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-debugging)


## Conclusion

### Advantages of TypeScript

* Reduces ambiguity, making collaboration easier
* Supports and improves automated testing
* Makes integration of third party libraries easier (because typing is clearer and more accessible in the IDE)

### Disadvantages of TypeScript

* Slows down coding with additional type annotations to write
* Adds additional compilation step
* Adds extra complexity to code (and another thing for devs to learn) — or does it just make the existing complexity more explicit?
