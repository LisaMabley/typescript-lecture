# Intro to Typescript

Good morning! Today is your lucky day, because I am going to tell you about my favorite programming language, TypeScript.

TypeScript is currently the 5th most commonly used coding language, after only JavaScript, HTML, SQL and Python. In the 2023 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, more than 43% of professional developers said they use TypeScript.

If you decide you want to learn TypeScript, I have some great news for you: you already know most of it.

That’s because if JavaScript is your vanilla ice cream, TypeScript is the banana split: it’s just vanilla JavaScript with some additional functionality added on top, like whipped cream and chocolate sauce and sprinkles. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. All your existing JavaScript code will run in TypeScript, but you’ll also have typing tools to help you write more readable and maintainable code and catch errors more quickly.

One part that might seem a little counter-intuitive is that TypeScript can’t run in your browser — it’s compiled down to JavaScript. So its sole purpose is to make the development process easier and more efficient; but at runtime, all the sprinkles are removed and it’s just plain JavaScript.

## JavaScript

Now, JavaScript has a lot of advantages:

* Runs in browsers
* Easy to learn and write
* Versatile
* Flexible

But some of these benefits can become shortcomings once the applications we are building become exponentially larger and more complex. TypeScript was first released by Microsoft in 2012 to overcome these shortcomings, while still retaining the best things about JavaScript.

So, what are these amazing TypeScript features, and why do we need them?

## TypeScript

### Adding TypeScript to your Project
Run `npm i typescript` in your terminal OR add the JavaScript and TypeScript Nightly extension to your VS Code.

### Compiling your TypeScript to JavaScript
Just run `tsc` in your terminal. Many compilation settings can be customized by adding a `tsconfig.json` file.

### Advantages

* Reduces ambiguity, making collaboration easier
* Supports and improves automated testing
* Makes integration of third party libraries easier

### Disadvantages

* Slows down coding with additional type annotations to write
* Adds additional compilation step
* Adds extra complexity (another thing for devs to learn) — or does it just make the existing complexity more explicit?
